2231,With regard to this anonymous master it is worth recording that in all probability he was at the beginning in such close relations with Duccio as to lend credibility to the opinion that Duccio's hand can be detected in some of his early works.,12298-21badia.jpg,Madonna and Child (no. 593),DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,religious,Italian,1301,1350

2237,The creation of a work of art of this kind was due to a combination of craftsmanship and painterly skills.,12322-8windsor.jpg,Triptych,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,religious,Italian,1301,1350

2239,"The triptych in the Royal Collection is comparable with examples in the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of which, according to varying degrees of attribution, are associated with Duccio or his workshop.The exact attribution of the present triptych is unsettled owing to the multiplicity of hands at work not only in Duccio's workshop as a whole, but even on the surface of individual paintings.",12322-8windsor.jpg,Triptych,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,religious,Italian,1301,1350

2242,"The inconsistencies apparent in the architecture of Annunciation (top left) or the design of the two thrones are not unknown in Duccio's own work, as revealed in the Maest&#224; of 1308-11 (Siena, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) with which this triptych is comparable in date or possibly slightly earlier.The iconography of the panels is also significant.",12322-8windsor.jpg,Triptych,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,religious,Italian,1301,1350

2245,"The Annunciation (top left) is comparable with the relevant scene (now in the National Gallery, London) from the Maest&#224;, whereas both Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata (top right) and Christ and the Virgin Enthroned (lower right) recall frescoes in the Upper Church of St Francis, Assisi (the former in the nave from the Life of Saint Francis and the latter, earlier in date and by Cimabue, in the transept).",12322-8windsor.jpg,Triptych,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,religious,Italian,1301,1350

2247,"The quantity of blood depicted in the central scene (some of it removed in an earlier restoration) is an unusual feature in a work on this scale.Probably before it became part of the Royal Collection the triptych had been dismantled and put in a heavy gothic frame, which was removed when it was cleaned in 1930.",12322-8windsor.jpg,Triptych,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,religious,Italian,1301,1350
2248,After this the triptych was displayed in a shadow box with a simpler frame.,12322-8windsor.jpg,Triptych,DUCCIO di Buoninsegna,religious,Italian,1301,1350

2331,"The panel was painted for the Nuremberg merchant family of Haller, whose arms appear in the bottom left corner of the panel of the Virgin.Virgin and Child at a Window was long assumed to be the work of the Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini, because of its composition and colouring.",12493-08lotdau.jpg,Lot Fleeing with his Daughters from Sodom,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550

2336,"It is presumed that Oswolt Krell, a merchant for the Ravensburg House in Nuremberg from 1495 to 1503, had asked the artist for a true portrait of representation.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2337,"Its notable size, similar to that adopted by Dürer for the portrait of his father two years earlier, and its setting, a half-length, suggests this.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2338,"In this way, it differs from the Tucher portraits, which were intended for private use.The background, as in the Tucher portraits (Schlossmuseum, Weimar), is divided between the curtain and landscape passage, unlike those, however, it is divided rather unevenly.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2339,"The bright red curtain is wide and occupies most of the space on the right; the landscape, on the left, is reduced to a foreshortening that shows a small part of a river that meanders toward the back, behind a group of tall trees.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550

2341,"The figure represented, set with obvious grandiosity, is found in front of the curtain, highlighted by intense colour.The large fur-lined cloak is casually placed on the right shoulder only, to show, on the left side, the rich black garment with the puffed sleeve.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2342,To the disorderly folds of the cloak correspond the parallel horizontal folds of the sleeve and the vertical ones of the garment.,12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2343,"The three-quarter position allows the painter to bring out the quality of the attire: the fur, silk shirt, and gold chain.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2344,"The careful, fastidious representation of these meaningful details creates a powerful foundation for the setting of the head: vigorous, strong features, the pronounced nose and the strong-willed mouth, the furrowed eyebrows, as if from a sudden start or fright that makes him direct his gaze off to the side behind him.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2345,"Everything works to make his face threateningly severe, which even the soft, light brown hair framing him does not attenuate.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550
2346,"To the energetic expression of the face corresponds the nervous look of his left hand clutching his cloak and that of the contraction of the knotted fingers of the right hand that leans on an invisible window sill.Colour, form, and proportion heighten the expression of supreme resolution, an expression that is the result of a serious psychological study that Dürer conducted on the merchant, who was the same age as the artist and who was later to become the mayor of Lindau, his native city.The two side panels that represent two ""sylvan men"" are wings to the portrait.",12498-12krel.jpg,Portrait of Oswolt Krel,Albrecht DÜRER,portrait,German,1501,1550

2355,The high quality of the painting is evident in the sensitive rendering of Christ's head and hands and in the sophisticated realization of texture and sculptural form in the richly coloured drapery.,12526-02salvat.jpg,Salvator Mundi,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550
2356,"Dürer lavished extraordinary attention on the fully worked-up underdrawing, portions of which can be seen with the naked eye, especially on the head, neck, and hands",12526-02salvat.jpg,Salvator Mundi,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550

2358,"The theme derives from the Gospel of St Luke (Luke 2, 41-52).On the bookmark at the bottom left of the panel, Dürer has recorded that this picture was `the work of five days', a pointed reference to his inscription on The Altarpiece of the Rose Garlands, the work of five months.",12539-07docto.jpg,Christ Among the Doctors,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550
2359,"Christ among the Doctors is not only a smaller panel, but the brushwork is much more spontaneous and the paint is applied with broad and fluid strokes.",12539-07docto.jpg,Christ Among the Doctors,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550
2360,"Despite Dürer's statement about five days, he based it on a number of careful studies, including one of Christ's gesticulating fingers.",12539-07docto.jpg,Christ Among the Doctors,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550
2361,"Although not present on the original painting, two early copies of the panel have the word `Romae' added to the inscription on the bookmark and this suggests that Dürer visited Rome late in 1506.",12539-07docto.jpg,Christ Among the Doctors,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550
2362,"It may also be significant that the original painting was in Rome's Galleria Barberini until its acquisition by Baron Heinrich von Thyssen-Bornemisza in 1935.The story recorded in the panel is of Christ's visit to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, where he debated with the learned Jewish doctors (or scribes).",12539-07docto.jpg,Christ Among the Doctors,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550

2370,"The two heads are constructed with an incisive and meticulous line, a reflection of Dürer's troubled search for moral austerity.",12572-6apostl.jpg,The Apostles Philip and James,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550
2371,"We may recall that this was a particularly delicate time in German history, shortly before the emergence of Martin Luther and the Reformation.The two saints inspire a diffuse sense of solemn veneration, in the passionate, severe eyes, the embittered curve of the mouths, and the overabundant beards, depicted as heavy, noble masses of coiling hair",12572-6apostl.jpg,The Apostles Philip and James,Albrecht DÜRER,religious,German,1501,1550
2372,"During his extended stay in Italy from 1621 to 1627, spending the majority of his time in Genoa, Van Dyck made his mark as a portraitist, and numbered many important families from the upper strata of Genoese society among his clients.",12957-armour.jpg,Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf,Sir Anthony van DYCK,portrait,Flemish,1601,1650
2373,It has yet to be clarified whether or not the Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf was one of these commissions; various attempts to identify the man in the picture have been inconclusive.,12957-armour.jpg,Portrait of a Man in Armour with Red Scarf,Sir Anthony van DYCK,portrait,Flemish,1601,1650

2545,"The goodness and grace of God ""at the moment of truth"" (Abraham sacrificing Isaac) serves as proof of the redeeming power and presence of servants of God both celestial (St. George) and mortal (Canon van der Paele).This is how van der Paele might have expressed the message of the painting-that paradise was at hand-a message confirmed by its being set in a very real but also sacred context.",13414-21paele.jpg,The Madonna with Canon van der Paele,Jan van EYCK,religious,Flemish,1401,1450

2554,"Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803)was an Italian tragic poet whose predominant theme was the overthrow of tyranny.To glorify the personality of this writer of tragedies, Fabre has clearly added to the faithfulness of the portrait a heroic tone, evident in the facial expression and the pose of the raised arm over which the brown mantle is slung all'antica.Beyond its value as a historical document, the work is also a striking example of the more severely classicistic current which emerged from the school of David, of whom Fabre was a pupil and close follower.The painting is signed and dated in the lower right corner, ""F. X.

2843,"This painting demonstrates an attempt to align himself with the landscape Impressionist painters, perhaps from a desire to make money from the sale of his works, and is in marked contrast to the more laboured works produced while he could still consider himself an amateur.The subject of a snowy landscape was a typical Impressionist device to enable the artist to study the effects of colour reflections on a white surface and was particularly favoured by Sisley.",14906-early08.jpg,"The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel",Paul GAUGUIN,landscape,French,1851,1900

2845,"The spontaneity of the brushwork and the subject matter would suggest that the canvas was painted out of doors, but there is a small related sketch without the two foreground figures, probably done in front of the motif, which presumably forms the basis for this more finished, studio painting.",14906-early08.jpg,"The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel",Paul GAUGUIN,landscape,French,1851,1900
2846,"This means that the two women were added later, and demonstrates that even at this date Gauguin did not feel tied to working solely from nature, and had already begun to use the subject of two conversing women which was to recur in his mature work",14906-early08.jpg,"The Garden in Winter, Rue Carcel",Paul GAUGUIN,landscape,French,1851,1900

2848,"His letters to friends in Paris chronicle what was for him a difficult period - he missed the cultural life of Paris, disliked the Danes, his wife's family in particular, and the harsh climate meant that he could do little work in the open air.",14908-early10.jpg,Gauguin at His Easel,Paul GAUGUIN,portrait,French,1851,1900

2850,His work became increasingly premeditated.,14908-early10.jpg,Gauguin at His Easel,Paul GAUGUIN,portrait,French,1851,1900
2851,"However, in the execution, particularly in the flickering brushwork, this painting is still close to the work of his Impressionist years.Gauguin's rather romantic characterization of the solitary figure labouring in a garret establishes the tenor of much later self-portraits, in which he depicted himself as artistic martyr, culminating in the series of works of 1889 in which he increasingly identified with Christ",14908-early10.jpg,Gauguin at His Easel,Paul GAUGUIN,portrait,French,1851,1900

2854,"Gauguin's role as mentor is alluded to in the way in which Laval gazes fixedly at the ceramic pot which was made by Gauguin in the winter of 1886-87, when he worked in Paris with the ceramicist Chaplet.The still-life with its piled up fruits, treated with tight diagonal brushstrokes and laid out on a white cloth, is reminiscent of Cézanne's painting Still-Life with Compotier which Gauguin owned at this date.",14913-1ponta01.jpg,Still-Life with Portrait of Laval,Paul GAUGUIN,still-life,French,1851,1900

2859,"At the same time they are seldom correct pictures of Tahitian life, from an anthropological standpoint, but rather feature recastings and recombinations of objects and persons taken out of their normal settings, as was the case with several of his paintings done in Brittany.The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's first stay in Tahiti are the Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary) and The Spectre Watches over Her (Manao Tupapau).",14954-tahiti01.jpg,Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary),Paul GAUGUIN,religious,French,1851,1900
2860,In Ia Orana Maria Gauguin places the Christian story into a setting where both the figures and the vegetation are Polynesian.,14954-tahiti01.jpg,Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary),Paul GAUGUIN,religious,French,1851,1900
2861,"A Tahitian woman, her young son, and two women standing nearby are shown in the obvious attitudes of the Virgin and Child with attendant saints or worshiping angels.Once again Gauguin has returned to the theme of the effect of profound religious faith on an apparently simple people, which had preoccupied him in some of his most important Breton works.",14954-tahiti01.jpg,Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary),Paul GAUGUIN,religious,French,1851,1900
2862,"The apparently effortless fusion of Christian iconography with Tahitian subject matter is in fact carefully contrived, with the poses of the background figures lifted from the relief carving on the Javanese temple of Borobudur, photographs of which Gauguin had taken with him to Tahiti",14954-tahiti01.jpg,Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary),Paul GAUGUIN,religious,French,1851,1900

2864,"The latter (in the Cleveland Museum of Art) depicts a naked woman, seen from behind, cast adrift in the waves, and in Fatata te miti he has reused the same subject, setting her within a Tahitian genre scene.",14977-tahiti23.jpg,By the Sea (Fatata te Miti),Paul GAUGUIN,landscape,French,1851,1900
2865,"In Ondine, Gauguin had treated the myth of the water-sprite who can only become human after having a child fathered by a man.",14977-tahiti23.jpg,By the Sea (Fatata te Miti),Paul GAUGUIN,landscape,French,1851,1900

2867,"In Fatata te miti the sexual abandonment is seen as part of the natural rhythm of Polynesian life (the two women do not appear perturbed at the presence of the fisherman in the background of the work), a notion that was integral to the highly popular Marriage of Loti, which Gauguin had read before visiting Tahiti and which was calculated to appeal to a Parisian audience",14977-tahiti23.jpg,By the Sea (Fatata te Miti),Paul GAUGUIN,landscape,French,1851,1900
2868,"The Moon and the Earth is Gauguin's depiction of an ancient Polynesian myth, in which Hina, the female spirit of the Moon, implores Fatou, the male spirit of the Earth, to grant humans eternal life.",14981-1paris02.jpg,Hina te Fatou (The Moon and the Earth),Paul GAUGUIN,mythological,French,1851,1900

2874,During his two years in Paris he painted far fewer works than before - large amounts of his time were taken up with organizing his show at Durand-Ruel's and on a number of literary projects.,14989-2ponta04.jpg,Breton Village in the Snow,Paul GAUGUIN,landscape,French,1851,1900

2896,"The handling of the light shows the fundamental influence of Caravaggio, while the refinement of the surfaces in the gleaming satin and damask draperies and the soft warmth of the velvets are inspired by Bronzino.Typical of Gentileschi are the arrested gestures standing out against the opaque shadow of the austere interior; the figure of Tibertius, silhouetted against the light as he cautiously peers at the angel; the system of curves formed by the wings, the body and the long palm branch of the angel in flight; and the outstretched arms of St. Cecilia and St. Valerianus.",15203-cecilia.jpg,"Sts Cecilia, Valerianus and Tiburtius",Orazio GENTILESCHI,religious,Italian,1551,1600

2919,"The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.Gérard, by contrast, sets the lady in a noble park loggia, where she seems to be inviting to conversation.",15231-4recamie.jpg,Madame Récamier,François GÉRARD,portrait,French,1801,1850

3076,Giorgione exploited the new style evolved in Venice through sensual subject matter.,15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500
3077,The Sleeping Venus is a case in point.,15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500
3078,"The reclining figure was originally accompanied by a small figure of Cupid, but this figure was painted over in 1843.Giorgione placed the Venus across the whole width of the painting.",15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500

3080,"Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin drapery upon which her creamy body lies.",15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500

3082,Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world.,15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500
3083,Thus the painting may be interpreted as a poetic evocation of a classical idyll.Several works of great beauty associated with Giorgione involve the collaboration of another distinctive master.,15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500

3087,"But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality.",15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500
3088,Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject.,15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500
3089,There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.If compared with Titian's Venus of Urbino the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed.,15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500
3090,"If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death",15943-venus.jpg,Sleeping Venus,GIORGIONE,mythological,Italian,1451,1500

3289,"However, the painting lacks a sense of substance and conviction, which reflects his difficulty in feeling himself as part of the world he is portraying.In the two years van Gogh spent in Paris he tried to assimilate French Impressionism, only to find that a new generation of painters were questioning its premises regarding both subject-matter and style.",17065-paris15.jpg,Restaurant de la Sir?ne at Asni?res,Vincent van GOGH,landscape,Dutch,1851,1900

3296,Although this choice of background indicates van Gogh's evident preoccupation with Japanese prints - he also made individual copies of selected prints at this date - the painting does not indicate any profound influence of Japanese graphic styles or perspectival devices upon his work.,17072-paris22.jpg,Portrait of P?re Tanguy,Vincent van GOGH,portrait,Dutch,1851,1900
3297,"But it is important to note that the motifs represented in the prints anticipate those that van Gogh would shortly resume when he left Paris and moved once again into a more rural setting - seasonal landscapes and portraits of regional types in costume.In his portraits of ordinary people van Gogh emphasized their sadness, dignity and kindness.",17072-paris22.jpg,Portrait of P?re Tanguy,Vincent van GOGH,portrait,Dutch,1851,1900

3530,Here the suggestion of weight in the supported Dead Christ is appropriate.,18234-0504grec.jpg,The Trinity,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3531,"The stress on the dead body of Christ, together with the clamorous mannerist colors and the rather loose composition of the figures, produces a feverish pathos.El Greco was not to repeat this subject",18234-0504grec.jpg,The Trinity,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3532,"After a short period of study in Greece, El Greco, one of the most renowned figure in Spanish art, went to Venice in the middle of the sixteenth century, where he worked in Titian's workshop, and where he became familiar with the art of Paolo Veronese, Jacopo Bassano and Tintoretto, as well as works by representatives of the North Italian Mannerist school.",18242-0603grec.jpg,Mary Magdalen in Penitence,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3535,"Like most of the painters coming from Italy, he was anxious to enter the service of King Philip II, but the Greek painter's immediacy of passion, ecstatic style, disturbing colours and visionary conceptions did not please the king's academic Italian taste.",18242-0603grec.jpg,Mary Magdalen in Penitence,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3536,"He was, however, appreciated by the religious orders and the aristocratic patrons of Toledo.The penitent Magdalen must have been painted at the beginning of his years in Toledo because the strong influence of paintings on the same theme by Titian can be observed.",18242-0603grec.jpg,Mary Magdalen in Penitence,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3537,"The ideal of beauty is still Titian's half-figure pictures of women, but the inner tension of the whole composition and the relation between man and nature already indicate the beginning of Mannerism.",18242-0603grec.jpg,Mary Magdalen in Penitence,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3538,The arrangement of the fingers of the right hand is a characteristic feature of El Greco's painting.,18242-0603grec.jpg,Mary Magdalen in Penitence,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3539,"It is assumed by some critics that the sitter of the painting was Jerónima de las Cuevas, the mistress of the artist",18242-0603grec.jpg,Mary Magdalen in Penitence,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3540,There are more than a hundred representations of St Francis executed by the workshop of El Greco mainly for the commissons of the three Franciscan monasteries and seven cloisters in Toledo.,18249-0610grec.jpg,The Ecstasy of St Francis,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3541,This formerly unknown signed painting was found during an inventory of the artworks in 1966 in Poland.,18249-0610grec.jpg,The Ecstasy of St Francis,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3542,"El Greco painted many representations of St Francis, all showing him in meditation, receiving the stigmata or experiencing a vision.",18264-0803grec.jpg,St Francis Receiving the Stigmata,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3543,"Devotion to St Francis was highly developed in Spain, and in El Greco's time there were in Toledo alone ten Franciscan religious institutions.",18264-0803grec.jpg,St Francis Receiving the Stigmata,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3547,The identity of the sitter is confirmed by a portrait in the Biblioteca Nacional in Madrid with an inscription of his name,18269-0808grec.jpg,Portrait of Doctor Rodrigo de la Fuente (El Médico),El GRECO,portrait,Spanish,1551,1600

3551,"For reasons of size, style, and subject matter, the following paintings probably came from the retable: the Annunciation, the widest painting, in the centre (the church was dedicated to the Virgin of the Annunciation); the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ, two paintings of the same size, on the left and right of the Annunciation; the Crucifixion above the Annunciation; and the Resurrection and Pentecost, another pair of identical size, flanking the Crucifixion (the whole forming a retable of a type known in the Escorial).",18320-1208grec.jpg,The Baptism,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3552,Such an arrangement gives a chronological sequence to the events of the Life of Christ.,18320-1208grec.jpg,The Baptism,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3553,The payment of 6000 ducados (for the paintings and retable) indicate a large commission.,18320-1208grec.jpg,The Baptism,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3554,"Small versions, probably models, exist for the three paintings more generally accepted as belonging to the retable, the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Shepherds and the Baptism of Christ.Probably originally on the right of the retable of the Colegio de Do&#241;a María, balancing the Adoration of the Shepherds, and painted at the same time.",18320-1208grec.jpg,The Baptism,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3555,"A small version, possibly the model for the large painting, is in the Galleria Corsini, Rome.",18320-1208grec.jpg,The Baptism,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3562,"The paintings for the high altar (still in place) were the Saint Joseph and the Christ Child, and above, the Coronation of the Virgin; and, for the side altars, the Saint Martin and the Beggar and the Virgin and Child with Saints were placed.Clad in gold damascened armour with a ruff typical of fashionable Toledan dress in El Greco's day, St Martin is shown astride a white horse as he prepares to cut his bright green cloak in half in order to share it with the beggar who stands on the left.",18330-1304grec.jpg,St Martin and the Beggar,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3569,He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition.,18350-1501grec.jpg,The Agony in the Garden,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3570,The version in Andújar is probably the prime version of the vertical type.,18350-1501grec.jpg,The Agony in the Garden,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3576,"The painting is not mentioned in the incomplete documentation for the decoration of the chapel, and if, as is probable, it was not painted at the same time, it cannot date much before June 1603, the date of the contract, and was more likely painted soon after the conclusion of litigation in August 1607.",18370-1605grec.jpg,St Ildefonso,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3577,"In its present position, it makes a grand pair to the Virgin of Charity, and is one of the most splendid of his 'portraits' of Saints.It is difficult, and perhaps not proper, to separate his portraits of Saints from his actual portraits.",18370-1605grec.jpg,St Ildefonso,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3581,The state of inspiration is brilliantly expressed.,18370-1605grec.jpg,St Ildefonso,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3582,"There is an infinite distinction in expression between the hand poised with the pen in this 'portrait' and the similar motif in the portrait of his son.In his depiction of St Ildefonso, El Greco anticipated a Baroque motif, that of the learned churchman.",18370-1605grec.jpg,St Ildefonso,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3589,"The intervention of El Greco's workshop can be assumed in all these paintings.In his religious compositions and portraits El Greco frequently repeated themes from his major works, with slight alterations, to meet different commissions.",18377-1704grec.jpg,The Agony in the Garden,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3590,He broke away from the Renaissance tradition and ceased to depict reality and nature.,18377-1704grec.jpg,The Agony in the Garden,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3591,In order to convey mystic emotions and to imbue his work with passion he distorted and elongated the forms and used stridently blazing colours to express the transcendental.,18377-1704grec.jpg,The Agony in the Garden,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600
3592,The Agony in the Garden is such mystic interpretation representative of El Greco's late years and mature style.The painting depicts the last night of Christ on the Mount of Olives.,18377-1704grec.jpg,The Agony in the Garden,El GRECO,religious,Spanish,1551,1600

3599,"The identification rests on the striking resemblance between his features and those of a documented miniature of Francisco de Pisa in a private collection, that was, at one time, ascribed to El Greco himself.The open book displayed on the table is identified by lettering on its pages as BOSIUS CANONICI, presumably an edition or commentary on the corpus of canon law.",18383-1710grec.jpg,A Prelate,El GRECO,portrait,Spanish,1551,1600

3607,"The map partially corrects the view of the city in which, to improve the composition as the inscription tells us, El Greco gave the Hospital of Don Juan Tavera a central place in the picture; transferring it from its actual setting so that the façade could be shown without blocking out the other important buildings.",18403-1903grec.jpg,View and Plan of Toledo,El GRECO,landscape,Spanish,1551,1600

3609,"The landscape is painted in brownish-green and blue tints, and the mythological and religious elements are minimal; with his pictures of Toledo El Greco created the Spanish landscape, a branch of art which was nevertheless neglected until the emergence of Velázquez.It is sometimes supposed that the young man is a portrait of El Greco's son, who was, however, at least thirty years old at that time",18403-1903grec.jpg,View and Plan of Toledo,El GRECO,landscape,Spanish,1551,1600

3677,"As several corrections by the painter, visible to the naked eye reveal, Guardi modified the strong perspective of the buildings at the right and moved the Salute closer to the centre of the composition.The view of the Molo in the direction of the entrance to the Grand Canal was a subject frequently depicted in Venetian vedute painting.",18765-guard307.jpg,View of the Molo towards the Santa Maria della Salute,Francesco GUARDI,landscape,Italian,1751,1800

3679,"Later the view of the Molo was usually shown without the Doges' Palace and without any kind of festivity.For this painting, Guardi undoubtedly drew inspiration from a work by Canaletto (c. 1740, private collection) which he may have known through a print by Antonio Visentini from 1742.",18765-guard307.jpg,View of the Molo towards the Santa Maria della Salute,Francesco GUARDI,landscape,Italian,1751,1800

3681,"However, a comparison with this source makes it clear that Guardi, despite the strong perspectival arrangement of this composition, neither subjected the cityscape to a strict perspectival system nor strove for an exact, detailed rendering of the architecture.",18765-guard307.jpg,View of the Molo towards the Santa Maria della Salute,Francesco GUARDI,landscape,Italian,1751,1800

3683,"Furthermore, Guardi's painting is not even half the size of the one by Canaletto.Guardi's small painting and its pendant, a view of the Piazzetta in the direction of San Giorgio Maggiore (also in the Galleria Franchetti, Venice), no longer satisfied the presumably more representative function of Canaletto's painting, but were purchased instead by an individual client who was as interested in the well-known Venetian cityscapes as in Guardi's painterly rendering of them.As with many of Francesco Guardi's paintings, the dating of this work is problematic.",18765-guard307.jpg,View of the Molo towards the Santa Maria della Salute,Francesco GUARDI,landscape,Italian,1751,1800

3685,"The shimmering effects of light and colour, especially in the wall surfaces of the buildings, and the nervous treatment of the sky and the figures on the Molo are characteristic of Guardi's extremely individualistic, transparent style in the last two decades of his career.",18765-guard307.jpg,View of the Molo towards the Santa Maria della Salute,Francesco GUARDI,landscape,Italian,1751,1800

4914,"However, the stylised terseness and enclosed character of the latter give way here to dramatic action in the open air, with a high degree of realism.In view of the historical circumstances and iconography, there can be no doubt whatsoever that this triptych was painted for the High Altar of the chapel of St John's Hospital.",26023-13john.jpg,St John Altarpiece,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

4922,"Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years.The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital.",26023-13john.jpg,St John Altarpiece,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

4929,"The left wing represents the donor with his patron saint, while the right wing features St Barbara, the hospital saint par excellence.The composition is a development on an idea of Rogier van der Weyden, who was the first to reduce the Lamentation to its three principal protagonists (apart from Christ) in a number of smaller compositions.",26062-17rein.jpg,Triptych of Adriaan Reins,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

4932,"The predominance of purple - including the marbling of the frame - means that the altarpiece is literally enveloped in the colour of the Passion.Two versions of this Lamentation are known: the central panel of the Kaufmann triptych in Rotterdam and the Rome Lamentation, both of which were probably painted at an earlier date.",26062-17rein.jpg,Triptych of Adriaan Reins,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4933,"The former in particular may be seen as the immediate compositional predecessor of the Reins triptych.Doubts as to the authorship of the work were expressed from an early stage, probably because the figures of St John and Mary Magdalene did not meet the idealised Memling image that had been formed by the nineteenth century, and because of the lack of an inscription with the artist's signature.",26062-17rein.jpg,Triptych of Adriaan Reins,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

4944,"It must have been a common ornament, because a version of it also appears in the Bruges Portrait of a young woman and in the allegorical figure of a girl in New York.",26068-18portra.jpg,Portrait of a Man at Prayer before a Landscape,Hans MEMLING,portrait,Flemish,1451,1500
4945,"The man's devotion is evidently directed towards a lost representation, probably of the Virgin and Child.When closed, this diptych would have displayed the coat-of-arms that is still to be found on the reverse.",26068-18portra.jpg,Portrait of a Man at Prayer before a Landscape,Hans MEMLING,portrait,Flemish,1451,1500
4946,The man probably belonged to the Lespinette family (Franche-Comté).,26068-18portra.jpg,Portrait of a Man at Prayer before a Landscape,Hans MEMLING,portrait,Flemish,1451,1500
4947,"Since its auction (as a work by Antonello da Messina) in 1894, the painting has been accepted as a Memling.",26068-18portra.jpg,Portrait of a Man at Prayer before a Landscape,Hans MEMLING,portrait,Flemish,1451,1500
4948,"It is generally compared with his portraits from the 1480s, and shows a particular similarity in its modelling to the Bruges Portrait of a young woman of 1480.It is understandable that some people should have been inclined to attribute this admirable portrait to Antonello, such is its precision and assurance of drawing and modelling of the face; but in the features, which are as though engraved, and the pointed steeple visible in the background, give a Flemish character of this picture",26068-18portra.jpg,Portrait of a Man at Prayer before a Landscape,Hans MEMLING,portrait,Flemish,1451,1500
4949,The triptych with the Virgin and Child Enthroned in Vienna must have been painted before 1488.,26082-25notri1.jpg,Triptych,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4950,"The present donor, dressed in a dark tabard, is not by Memling and conceals another figure who turns out to be none other than Abbot Jan Crabbe, who died in 1488.",26082-25notri1.jpg,Triptych,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4951,The wings show the two St Johns with the `living' figures of Adam and Eve in niches on the exterior (seen when the wings are closed).For the first time the painting includes the italianate motif of putti stretching festoons across the scene at the top.,26082-25notri1.jpg,Triptych,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4952,"Similar figures appear on a couple of other occasions in Memling, including the Resurrection triptych (Paris, Musée du Louvre) and the Virgin Enthroned in Florence",26082-25notri1.jpg,Triptych,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4953,"The picture shows one of the panels of the Triptych of Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation which is made up of three panels, all three of which are painted on both sides.",26100-26vani11.jpg,Vanity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4954,This reversible painting would seem to have been intended for use as an aid to private meditation.,26100-26vani11.jpg,Vanity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4955,"When the panels are folded slightly inwards, the triptych will stand unsupported - for example, on a table.",26100-26vani11.jpg,Vanity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

4957,"A woman wearing a diadem in her long hair, with a griffon and two greyhounds at her feet, and a mirror in her hand in which she contemplates her naked image without shame, represents vanity and lust",26100-26vani11.jpg,Vanity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4958,The legend of this fourth-century doctor of the Church only began to take shape in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.,26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4959,"He was raised to the rank of cardinal, and given a faithful companion in the shape of a lion, from whose paw he was said to have removed a thorn.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

4961,"The motif of the saint beating his chest with a stone was probably inspired by Italian examples, although no clear prototype springs to mind.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4962,"Nevertheless, this still appears to be the first Netherlandish work to present on such a monumental scale a subject that was to become one of art's iconographical mainstays from the sixteenth century onwards.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4963,"Interestingly, several similar paintings, possibly influenced by Memling, were produced in Bruges around this period and immediately afterwards.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4964,"The saint kneels before a crucifix, bearded and bald, with the dark brown robe of the penitent about his naked body.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

4968,The lion lies down faithfully beside him.,26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4969,"The scene is enacted on a rocky plateau before a cave, which is the hermit's retreat.This fairly large panel is not very well known, and is sometimes treated with a degree of caution.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4970,"Nevertheless, it is a fine example in every respect of Memling's vision and technique.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4971,"Monumentally conceived, yet executed with an undramatically fresh and guileless realism, this St Jerome is one of the most elegant large figures in the artist's oeuvre.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4972,"The spatial character of the slim, half-naked saint is comparable with the Stuttgart Bathsheba.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4973,"The extremely free underdrawing, the elongated body shapes and a physiognomy that seems to prefigure that of Van Cleve or Massys suggest that both paintings were executed fairly late, although additional evidence would be required for more precise dating.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4974,"A characteristic Memling trait is the way the emblematic attributes such as the crucifix, the lion and the cardinal's clothes are included in a natural manner.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4975,"Taken together, it is like a moment from a story, despite the fact that the depicted elements refer to different periods of the saint's life.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4976,"Furthermore, the crucifix consists of a genuine flesh-and-blood little body, put to death in miniature, with no attempt on the artist's part to portray it as a vision.We do not know whether the panel was autonomous, or whether it had wings or a companion piece.",26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4977,The small fragment depicting St Jerome and the Lion might have formed part of the left wing (private collection),26106-28jerome.jpg,St Jerome,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4978,This small panel was only discovered relatively recently (1945) and so does not feature in most of the Memling literature.,26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4979,"Nevertheless, it is an interesting little work which corresponds fully with Memling's style and spatial approach.",26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4980,The composition derives from Rogier van der Weyden.,26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4981,It portrays the episode in which Jerome removes the thorn from the lion's paw.,26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4982,The architectural setting is a characteristic Memling invention.,26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4983,"The scene is viewed through a heavy round arch in brown stone, positioned at an angle close to the picture plane.",26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4984,It is related to the more modest little arches in the wings containing the Allegory of True Love.,26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4985,"The fairly heavily dotted little trees in the background also recall that work.The odd way the image is cropped to the left and right is not the result of its having been narrowed at some stage, but is in fact deliberate.",26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4986,The angled position of the arch might indicate that this was once a left wing.,26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4987,The panel has been cut off at the top and bottom.,26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4988,"Considering the size of the figure and the wooded landscape, it could be a side panel for the St Jerome in Basel",26107-29jerome.jpg,St Jerome and the Lion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4989,"A number of correspondences, including dimensions, origins and inscriptions prove that the three fragments In Bucharest (the Standing Virgin and Child and the two panels with donors) belong together.",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4990,They were cut down to matching size obviously before 1656.,26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4991,"The Virgin, who is clearly standing up as she reaches the height of the column capitals and does not have the Child on her lap, has been cut in half.",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4992,"The donors, who are kneeling, have been trimmed at the top and bottom to more or less the same height.",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4993,It is extremely difficult after so much time to determine why the painting was mutilated in this way.,26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4994,"The darker colour to the man's right, and above all the red drapery to the woman's left, seem to be original, at least in part and are thus likely to be remnants of the patron saints who originally stood alongside the donors .",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4995,The hypothesis that the three paintings originally belonged to a single fixed panel is strengthened by the half dowel-holes that are still to be seen on the inner edges of the portraits.,26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4996,"The three panels are thus fragments of the original vertical planks of the painting, which were linked by internal dowel pegs.",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4997,"We ought, therefore, to imagine a composition similar to the Virgin with donor in Ottawa, but with an extra figure on the opposite side.",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4998,"If there was a little more space above the Virgin, the original panel must have measured roughly 100 x 100 cm.The landscape behind the man is painted over a piece of wood inset at a later date.",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
4999,Similar triangular pieces have also been inserted to the left and right of the woman.,26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5000,"Like the horizontal strip above the heads in both panels, these additions (to replace damaged or sawn-out sections?)",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5001,"were already present in 1656, when the panels were part of the collection of Leopold Wilhelm",26143-37frag1.jpg,Donor,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5002,The composition is a large-scale variant of the left wing of the Floreins triptych.,26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5003,So detailed are the figures in their execution and so precisely do the architecture and the landscape match Memling's style that an unknown work by the master must lie at its basis.,26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5004,"After all, it is difficult to believe that a follower would be capable of producing such a penetrating, complex and monumental variant in the master's pure style of an existing small composition.",26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5005,"The general pictorial treatment is harder and more contrasting than we are accustomed to in autograph works, and leans more towards the Master of the Legend of St Lucy.",26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5006,"If it is indeed by that master, then it is his technically most accomplished work.",26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5007,It might also be based on a design provided by Memling which was executed by another painter (in his workshop?).,26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5008,The painting would appear at any rate to date from the final quarter of the fifteenth century.,26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500
5009,It was unknown until relatively recently.,26163-0546nati.jpg,Nativity,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

5011,The triptych is related to Memling's large altarpiece executed for the Cathedral of Lübeck representing the same scenes of Christ' Passion.It is assumed that an early sixteenth-century Bruges master combined elements of a lost Memling triptych with Memling's Lübeck altarpiece to produce this triptych,26166-08notri1.jpg,Crucifixion,Hans MEMLING,religious,Flemish,1451,1500

5027,The emphasis on gentility and opulence intensified in Metsu's works during the final years  of his career as did his painstaking technique which became harder and drier.,26346-composin.jpg,A Young Woman Composing Music,Gabriel METSU,genre,Dutch,1651,1700
5028,Such works as the Young Woman Composing Music present a rarefied view of the leisure life of moneyed urbanites.,26346-composin.jpg,A Young Woman Composing Music,Gabriel METSU,genre,Dutch,1651,1700

5037,"Beside the couple a table is laid with a silver pot, some dried fish and a small loaf of bread, but the way it has been truncated at one end gives it the look of a stage prop.",26350-portarti.jpg,Portrait of the Artist with His Wife Isabella de Wolff in a Tavern,Gabriel METSU,portrait,Dutch,1651,1700

5039,"The room opens up to the rear at the right, giving a view of a sunny courtyard in which a market stall has been erected.Although the painting was for many years known simply as The Lovers at Breakfast, the two protagonists, quite different in type, have been identified as the artist and Isabella de Wolff, whom he married in 1658 and who was a niece of the painter Pieter de Grebber.The iconography of the painting distinguishes it as part of a painting tradition well-known to the educated contemporary viewer: the carousing, feasting couple, the ambience of the tavern with the landlady at the blackboard, the highly significant bread and fish still-life on the table.",26350-portarti.jpg,Portrait of the Artist with His Wife Isabella de Wolff in a Tavern,Gabriel METSU,portrait,Dutch,1651,1700

5657,The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background.,31985-1deposi.jpg,Deposition,Jacopo PONTORMO,religious,Italian,1501,1550
5658,"This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ.",31985-1deposi.jpg,Deposition,Jacopo PONTORMO,religious,Italian,1501,1550

5662,"The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin.",31985-1deposi.jpg,Deposition,Jacopo PONTORMO,religious,Italian,1501,1550

5665,"The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens.",31985-1deposi.jpg,Deposition,Jacopo PONTORMO,religious,Italian,1501,1550
5666,"The transparent shadows do not annul the colours, but actually become them, in the flesh tones invested with subtle shades of pink and green.The cloaked man wearing a strange hat, almost imperceptible against the background of the painting behind the arm of the Virgin, may possibly be the artist himself.",31985-1deposi.jpg,Deposition,Jacopo PONTORMO,religious,Italian,1501,1550

6452,"The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas.",35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6453,"The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized.",35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6456,But the landscape settings of the Dresden and Detroit paintings bear no resemblance whatsoever to the site at Ouderkerk.,35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6457,They are Ruisdael's inventions.,35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6458,The cemetery never had monumental ruins.,35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6459,"Those seen in the Dresden version were transplants from the shattered remains of Egmond Castle near Alkmaar, a site about forty kilometres from Ouderkerk; they also are based on a preparatory drawing.",35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6460,The ruins seen in the Detroit painting are probably derived from the ruins of Egmond's old Abbey Church.,35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6463,The stream was included as a traditional allusion to the passage of time.,35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6464,Most remarkable is the barren beech tree in the Dresden picture that gestures toward the three tombs and heavenwards.,35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6465,If ever a tree was capable of seducing a viewer to accept the pathetic fallacy of endowing natural forms with human feelings and emotions it is this dead beech.The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes.,35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6469,"Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope?",35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6470,"It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting.",35708-jewish_c.jpg,The Jewish Cemetery,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6475,"Although Ruisdael, perhaps the greatest and the most versatile Dutch landscape specialist, did not invent this type of picture, he became one of its most distinguished practitioners.This painting may represent a view in Gooiland, a district to the east of Amsterdam; there are, however, at least four other, smaller landscapes by Ruisdael that show the same view or part of it with considerable variations, and it is clear that he was not attempting strict topographical accuracy.",35717-ruined_c.jpg,An Extensive Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Village Church,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700
6476,"Despite the pretence of spontaneity, this work, like all landscape paintings of the time, is a synthetic product of the artist's studio.Its dominant feature is the sky, to which two thirds of the picture surface is devoted and which is also reflected in the water of the foreground.",35717-ruined_c.jpg,An Extensive Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Village Church,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6478,"Almost more remarkable than the truthful record of the shape, density and illumination of the clouds is the illusion that they are moving through space and over our heads (we tend to think that perspective does not govern cloudscapes, but these seem to taper towards the horizon and broaden at the upper edge of the painting).",35717-ruined_c.jpg,An Extensive Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Village Church,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6481,"By letting us look down into the bastion standing below the horizon line, the painter suggests that we are viewing it from some improbably high place, higher also than the shore on which the peasants graze their flock (both figures and animals were painted by Adriaen van der Velde, a division of labour quite common in Dutch landscapes).",35717-ruined_c.jpg,An Extensive Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Village Church,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6484,"A rush of water carrying away a broken tree, a house huddled on a slope, and tiny figures beneath a clouded sky - all these components make it possible to see the painting as a piece of 17th-century speculation on the romantic opposition of man and the elements",35734-water_fx.jpg,Waterfall in Norway,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6486,"The opening of the view suggests that he was impressed by Philips Koninck's panoramic views, but the fresh atmospheric effect, the brilliant glittering daylight which brightens the landscapes, the reflections, and vivid colours in the shadows are completely personal.",35735-waterfa.jpg,Landscape with Waterfall,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

6488,"This motif was popularized by Allart van Everdingen after he returned to Holland in 1644 from a trip to Norway and Sweden, and Ruisdael, who never visited Scandinavia, derived his torrential falls in northern landscapes from Everdingen's art",35735-waterfa.jpg,Landscape with Waterfall,Jacob Isaackszon van RUISDAEL,landscape,Dutch,1651,1700

7287,The picture shows the conclusive combat between the captains of the two armies: Niccol&#242; da Tolentino unseating Bernardino della Ciarda.Uccello's obsession with displaying his mastery of perspective (such as the long white and red lances or the exceptional horses that have rolled over on the ground) and the dramatic nature of the clash between the knights combine with his almost magical story telling.,40370-2battle.jpg,Bernardino della Ciarda Thrown Off His Horse,Paolo UCCELLO,historical,Italian,1401,1450

8047,"They are represented against a landscape that is rendered down to the finest detail, with its rivers and mountains, grass and leaves so precisely drawn they could almost be counted and tiny figures visible in the distance in the streets of imaginary towns - a favourite motif of the Flemish masters.Pictures showing busts of Christ and the Virgin had existed earlier north of the Alps, but a sequence of several saints shown half length seems to derive from a type of altarpiece found in Italy from the 13th century onward.",44024-0braque.jpg,Braque Family Triptych,Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450

8061,"She and the executioner are turning away from each other and from their victim, as if painfully conscious of the crime that has been committed.Interestingly, however, the figure of Salome looks like a variant on the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation scene of the St. Columba Altarpiece (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), where the figure's knees are placed apart in an even more balletic position.",44042-3john.jpg,St John Altarpiece (right panel),Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450
8062,"Rogier was obviously able to make effective use of this elaborate and artificial pose in various circumstances, and only the worldly magnificence of Salome's dress and the context cause the viewer to assess it differently here.",44042-3john.jpg,St John Altarpiece (right panel),Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450
8063,"In addition, Salome's grave and melancholy face does not in fact differ much from the face of the Virgin Mary in that Annunciation, although in this later version it is leaning at rather too pronounced an angle to express grace.",44042-3john.jpg,St John Altarpiece (right panel),Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450

8065,"The two small panels, representing the Madonna and St Catherine of Alexandria, respectively, probably formed a diptych.The busts of prophets on the outside of the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck were the model for the bust of God the Father at the top of the left panel.",44046-1diptych.jpg,Diptych,Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450

8074,"Compared to figures in works by Rogier's own hand the figures here, particularly in the Crucifixion, seem excessively emotional; instead of radiating dignified grief they are uttering loud cries of lamentation.Once again, the design of the triptych must have been by an assistant in Rogier's workshop.",44047-2abegg.jpg,Abegg Triptych,Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450

8077,"The folds of the robe, however, are more strongly modeled.The cloak in particular, very dynamically draped and with a large fold flung backward over the shoulder, gives the figure a sense of agitation that is in tune with the character of this painting as a whole, but not with its model.",44047-2abegg.jpg,Abegg Triptych,Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450
8078,"Similarly, Mary Magdalene's cloak slipping down from her hips picks up a motif from the Deposition, but combines it with an extrovert gesture foreign to that picture, with the saint suddenly flinging up her arms.The series of the three panels follows a chronological sequence: the sculptural Annunciation group in the donor's loggia refers to Christ's becoming man; in the central panel Christ has just died, and the sun and moon turn dark as His companions break into loud lamentations; on the right Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, and a servant are approaching with a ladder to take the dead body down from the Cross",44047-2abegg.jpg,Abegg Triptych,Rogier van der WEYDEN,religious,Flemish,1401,1450

8121,In the 1740s the rustic scenes of Zais acquire a simplicity and sincerity more like the pastoral scenes of Zuccarelli with their more light-hearted themes and softer colour.,44513-landsc_r.jpg,Landscape with River and Bridge,Giuseppe ZAIS,landscape,Italian,1701,1750

8127,That movement provided the political and cultural backdrop for one of the most important and influential groups in Italian art in the second half of the nineteenth century: the Macchiaioli.,44528-federi06.jpg,"Place d'Anvers, Paris",Federico ZANDOMENEGHI,landscape,Italian,1851,1900

8129,"The core of the Macchiaioli consisted of eleven painters born between 1824 and 1838, most important of them among the older painters were Giovanni Fattori, Silvestro Lega, Serafino de Tivoli, and Vincenzo Cabianca, while Giuseppe Abbati and Telemaco Signorini belonged to the younger.",44528-federi06.jpg,"Place d'Anvers, Paris",Federico ZANDOMENEGHI,landscape,Italian,1851,1900

8143,"Although Zoffany has depicted the architectural features of the Tribuna with a fair degree of accuracy, he has rearranged the works of art and in some cases altered their scale.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8144,"In fact, he has also incorporated a number of paintings from that part of the Medici collection housed in the Palazzo Pitti, as well as including several additional pieces of sculpture.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8145,"The painter thus successfully gives the gallery a more crowded and undoubtedly richer appearance than it had during the eighteenth century, and by this means has facilitated his rendering of the complicated sightlines of the room and the perspectival inlaid marble decoration of the floor.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8146,"The setting is therefore somewhat idealised, but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the Tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship, with its emphasis on the antique, the High Renaissance, the Bolognese school and Rubens.Zoffany painted the picture in Florence expressly for Queen Charlotte, beginning in 1772.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8147,"Much of the composition was completed the following year, but the artist continued working on it intermittently until late in 1777, making changes some of which are now only visible by X-ray.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8148,"Notable among these changes is the inclusion of a self portrait on the left of the composition, where the artist has shown himself peering round the unframed canvas of the Virgin and Child by Raphael.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8149,"For this purpose, it is almost as if the painter has abandoned his easel, partly visible in the lower right corner of the picture, and walked across or around the back of the room to partake in the discussion.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8150,"The figures in the picture, all of whom are identifiable, fall into three groups: those on the left between the sculptures of Cupid and Psyche and Satyr with the Cymbals; those in the foreground, right of centre, gathered around the Venus d'Urbino by Titian; and those on the right around the Venus de' Medici.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8151,"These portraits were meticulously painted by Zoffany and won widespread admiration, although apparently not from George III and Queen Charlotte, who claimed that such recognisable figures were inappropriate to the scene.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
8152,"In essence, however, Zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view, much exploited by Flemish painters in the seventeenth century, with the conversation piece evolved by British painters during the eighteenth century, although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.Royal patronage enabled the artist to have the Venus d'Urbino by Titian taken down from the wall for copying after the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Ferdinando I) had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.Correspondingly, there are one or two references in the picture to the Royal Collection: the Virgin and Child by Raphael, held by the artist, was a work that was offered to George III by Earl Cowper (this is the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Samian Sibyl by Guercino, seen at the lower edge of the composition, is a pendant to the Libyan Sibyl by the same artist bought by George III in the 1760s.The Tribuna of the Uffizi is a technical tour de force.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800

8154,"Controlled brushwork and careful application are the hallmarks of Zoffany's style, and they are seen at their best in this famous picture without any of the loss of verve that such a long and elaborate undertaking might have forced upon the artist.",44680-tribuna.jpg,The Tribuna of the Uffizi,Johann ZOFFANY,interior,German,1751,1800
